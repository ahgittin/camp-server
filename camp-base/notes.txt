hi Folks-

Wanted to let everyone know what conclusions we reached in the meeting on IRC yesterday on this topic:

(1) start a separate project "camp-server" in github/brooklyncentral, which will be *independent* of brooklyn-core, and will provide much of what is needed to stand up a CAMP REST server.

(2) then work on a brooklyn-camp in brooklyncentral/brooklyn which stitches the REST API above to Brooklyn entities

At the end of this, everything in Brooklyn will speak CAMP, and there will be a natural way (through Entity) to expose new PaaS through Brooklyn, like what we've done for Cloud Foundry and OpenShift (which could do with some updating).

CAMP is still evolving in places, but it's stable enough that there is something useful to work towards. If you're looking for tasks to help with, give a shout on IRC.

Best
Alex

PS. We're starting by refactoring brooklyn utils so it can be used in camp-server. This should also help with groovy neutrality.

PPS. Notes from etherpad below.

github brooklyncentral/camp-server

camp-server
    io.brooklyn.camp.
            (could we get "io.camp" or something else ... campserver? ???)
        api/
            CampPlatform
            ComponentTemplate
            ...
        util/
            collection/
                interface CollectionLookupProvider<T>
                    T get(id)
                    Iterator<T> iterator()
            dto/
                interface ToDto<X,XDto>
                    XDto toDto(X)
                class DtoUtils
                    // does reflection stuff
                BasicCampPlatform
                    register templates and instances (and engines)
                    get(type, id)
        impl/
            BasicResource (implements ToDto<BasicResource,ResourceDto>
            BasicComponentTemplate
            BasicComponent newInstance(Map config, List relationships)
            BasicAssemblyTemplate
            BasicPlatformComponentTemplate
            ...
        dto/
            *Dto
        server/
        endpoints/*Endpoint - returns the DTO's


github brooklyncentral/brooklyn-camp
OR github brooklyncentral/brooklyn/ usage/camp/
?

brooklyn-camp
io.brooklyn.camp.brooklyn
?
(adapter classes to configure the above)


ROADMAP

* dto classes and endpoints (jersey resources) to have a rest server
* impl classes (abstract or composable?) which can make dto's
* connect impl classes to brooklyn
(then see what's next...)
a "camp component wrapper" would be good - e.g. Entity asEntity(CampComponent)

END
