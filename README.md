The CAMP Server project has been donated to the Apache Software Foundation,
<a href="http://brooklyn.io/">Brooklyn</a> project.
You can find the code at 
<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn/tree/master/camp">github apache/incubator-brooklyn /camp</a>.

<p>

The CAMP server at that location can still be used independently of Brooklyn.
